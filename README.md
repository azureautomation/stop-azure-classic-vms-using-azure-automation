Stop Azure Classic VMs using Azure Automation
=============================================

            

Stops one or more Azure Classic VMs. Can be hooked up to a schedule to stop VMs continually at certain times of day.


The runbook depends on an Automation Credential asset containing OrgID (AAD) credentials with access to your Azure subscription. Live ID is not supported for non-interactive authentication by Azure PowerShell.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
